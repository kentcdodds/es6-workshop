[How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub][egghead]

## Project setup

It is recommended you use [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/) rather than [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/). But if you'd
rather stick with `npm`, simply replace `yarn` in the commands below with `npm`.

1. Fork and clone the repo
2. Run `yarn run setup` to verify your system and install dependencies
3. Create a branch for your PR

You can run `yarn run` to see what scripts are available.

## Add yourself as a contributor

This project follows the [all contributors][all-contributors] specification. To add yourself to the table of
contributors on the README.md, please use the automated script as part of your PR:

```console
yarn run add-contributor
```

Follow the prompt. If you've already added yourself to the list and are making a new type of contribution, you can run
it again and select the added contribution type.

## Where to contribute

This project uses [`split-guide`](https://github.com/kentcdodds/split-guide) to make maintaining the `exercises` and
`exercises-final` files easier. The `exercises` and `exercise-final` folders are actually generated code via the
`generate` script. So any changes you make should go in a `templates` directory. When you've made your changes,
please run `yarn run generate` to regenerate the exercises and commit those changes as part of your pull request.

### Development

The best workflow for adding/changing tests is to run `yarn run dev` which will fire up [`onchange`][onchange] for
`split-guide` and the `exercises-final` tests in watch mode ([learn more][jest-watch]). With this going, you can open up
the relevant files in the `templates` directory and start making changes. When you save your changes, the files will
be generated and the `exercises-final` tests will be re-run.

### Extra Credit

There are definitely more features we could add tests for, and you can also add tests to existing features. You can put
these at the bottom in the "Extra Credit" section with `test.skip`. This way people who work through the solutions
quickly can have something to solidify their learning further while others finish the core content. Please follow the
instructions above when contributing. Thanks for your help!

### Quizzes

There are a bunch of quizzes in the quizzes folder. It'd be awesome to get more of these! I recorded
[a video](https://youtu.be/LlNGtPFK9OM) showing how it works. Pretty much just open the `quizzes` directory and follow
the current conventions there! For development, just run `yarn run quiz` and start developing and seeing the output!

## opt into git hooks

There are git hooks set up with this project that are automatically installed when you install dependencies. They're
really handy, but are turned off by default (so as to not hinder new contributors). You can opt into these by creating
a file called `.opt-in` at the root of the project and putting this inside:

```
precommit
```
